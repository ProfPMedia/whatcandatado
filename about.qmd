Welcome to *What Can Data Do?* - a place for the data curious! Unleashing the power of data, one fascinating byte at a time.

Hi, I'm Lloyd Palum.

My students call me Prof. P., and with more than 30 years of experience in building data-intensive systems and teaching how to coax value from data at scale, I can help you crack the code and become more data-capable.

Let's unlock your data's value together!
