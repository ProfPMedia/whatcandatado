    "## Correction Cascades\n",
    "\n",
    "The lecture touches upon the concept of correction cascades. Using an illustrative example, imagine you have a model (Model A) that predicts the temperature for the next day. Another model (Model B) uses the output from Model A to predict how many bicycles will be needed at a rental station based on the forecasted temperature. If Model A's predictions change or are inaccurate, it directly impacts Model B's predictions. This interconnected reliance and the potential for errors to cascade from one model to another exemplify the challenges of correction cascades."
